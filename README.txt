# Summary

Inspired by http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:334917/ this goes a few steps further.

It is intended for dual extruder printers, although it can be made with a single extruder.  A dual extruder will allow the labels to be in a contrasting colour.  For single extruders, you can omit the label STL.

The SCAD file can generate a script (shell script, run under Unix or emulator) which when run, will call the SCAD file again and generate pairs of STLs for each atom.

I have tried to represent electronegativity by the length of a collar on each peg, although this could perhaps be improved.  It would be great to be able to visually and intuitively show which bonds are higher energy!

# Print Settings

Printer: Prussa i3
Rafts: No
Supports: Yes
Resolution: 0.1
Infill: optional

Notes: 
Some experimentation will get the best gap between the support and the atoms, and a little cleaning with a sharp knife and or small side cutters is needed.

# Post-Printing

Use side cutters and a sharp knife to clean away supports.

I also dip in acetone (for ABS) or chloroform (for PLA and PETG) to get a shiny finish
